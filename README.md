# Tidier-Audio-Tag-Naming-Convention
Keep your digital music library clean with MP3Tag actions (with more applications and conventions to be added!)

## About (and why I am sharing my completely anal convention)
For as long as I can remember, I have been incredibly anal about keeping my music library organised. With MP3Tag, I’ve been so focused on building actions to keep my library up to date and accurate that it has become a passion of mine. Maybe releasing my ideas and “standards” will be of no use to anyone, but I personally believe that it’s something that will help out every digital music collector.

Maybe it’s all thanks to the days of Morpheus and Kazaa with their terrible filenames and tags all over the place.
Feel free to contribute, message me with ideas and who knows, maybe together we’ll all categorise and build on different types of naming conventions! I can’t be the only tidy tag obsessive!

## How to use with MP3Tag
```
Download MP3Tag at https://www.mp3tag.de/en/download.html
To import the Actions download the latest version of the file (within 'TAT Actions') or 'Community Contributed Actions' and import to actions.
OR 
navigate to ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Mp3tag\data\actions```
OR
```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Mp3tag\data\actions and paste the file there.
```

### Future Goals
With interest and time, I hope my conventions (and those who contribute their own) has support for exported tag 'actions' for Musicbrainz, Musicbee, Foobar2000 and even AutoHotKey.

Eventually, I'd love to share my convention for naming Movies, Videos, TV Series' and so forth. It'd be great to see how others do it as well. Everyone has their own preferences, which is why I haven't considered any of my ideas to become a standard.
