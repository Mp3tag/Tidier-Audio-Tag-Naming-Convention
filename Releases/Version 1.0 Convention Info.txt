KEEP OR OBTAIN COVER ART

Cover art is very useful and users should make an effort attach quality cover art images for every album/track. The aim should be for the cover art image to be at least 500x500 pixels.
Covert art should be stored in JPEG format (use image edit program to convert the image file from other formats to JPEG).
Cover art image should be placed in the album sub folder and should have the name (this will enable players to automatically pick up the cover art).
Additional cover art or associated images can be placed (preferably in JPEG format) in the album sub folder with suitable explanation file names and if possible tagged.
